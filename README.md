LightWave Digital is proud to present the latest edition of LightWave 3D, packed with a range of innovative features and functions designed to significantly enhance the workflow for 3D content creators. The LightWave 2023 edition introduces radically improved capabilities to our award-winning rendering pipeline, alongside substantial performance enhancements in both the Layout and Modeler modules.

## Features of NewTek LightWave 3D:

Two New Global Illumination Render Engines
LightWave, long known for the beauty of its render engine, gains new advancements in LightWave 2020 with the redesign of the Global Illumination rendering engine, bringing two versions for artists: Brute Force, an unbiased radiosity engine, and Irradiance Cache, an interpolated radiosity engine. Using the new render engines independently or in concert will assure you get the real-world render results you seek, with higher quality and more control.

Two New Shaders in FiberFX
The new hair shaders in LightWave 2020 deliver more realistic hair leveraging the physical based renderer. Principled Hair Material is based on the Principled BSDF settings. The five inputs: Color, Cutical Tilt, Roughness, Radial Roughness and Index of Refraction provide a simple interface for spectacular results. With AFC Hair Shader (Artist Friendly Control â€” a simplified approach) the specular settings are divided into two sections: Primary, for reflection of the front side of the stroke and Secondary for the reflection bounced off the backside of the stroke. Now, you have the option to select a simple artist friendly shading option or complete control for the look you desire.

Redesigned Motion System
LightWave 2023 provides the ability to change Rotation Order per item and is saved with the scene file. This allows for an easier transition from other applications to LightWave. Additionally, instances of Gimbal lock can be avoided and items you are animating can be allowed to follow a more natural rotation order.
